# 🧬 DermaScope - Skin Cancer Detection using CNN and ISIC Dataset

DermaScope is a deep learning-based project for automatic detection of skin cancer from dermatoscopic images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It utilizes the **ISIC dataset** — the world's largest publicly available skin lesion image dataset — to train and evaluate the model.
